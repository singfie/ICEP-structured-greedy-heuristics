# ICEP Greedy Structured Heuristics
Structural heuristics for the deterministic (D-ICEP) and planning (S-ICEP) version of the Isolated Community Evacuation Problem (ICEP)

The D-ICEP represents the base version of the ICEP with deterministic data. Due to the high complexity of the problem, large instances are difficult to solve. The structural heuristics (phase 1 and phase 2) allow for quicker solution times in comparison to commercial solvers (see the repository on https://github.com/singfie/ICEP-exact-implementation for an exact implementation with a commercial solver).

The S-ICEP is a modified version of the D-ICEP for planning purposes. It adds a two-stage stochastic model structure with recourse. The scenario-independent first stage of the model includes the decision on an optimal evacuation resource fleet. The scenario-dependent second stage optimizes the evacuation route plan for a given evacuation scenario. The structure-based greedy search heuristics in this package allow for also solving the S-ICEP more quickly than with the D-ICEP.
